- EMS MDT logging with screenshots

- XP + bonus pay system
- Configurable through config.lua

ðŸ§° DEPENDENCIES
- qb-core
- ox_target
- ox_lib

ðŸ§ª DEV COMMANDS
These can be run in F8 or chat by players with proper job permissions:

- /forceconsent     â†’ simulate a patient accepting surgery
- /forceillness     â†’ instantly trigger a solo surgery event
- /forcesuccess     â†’ give XP & simulate successful outcome
- /forcetrauma [name] â†’ force a trauma event by name (e.g. /forcetrauma Gun Shot Wound)

ðŸŽ¯ EMS INTEGRATION
This version uses `ox_target` to create a surgery option for EMS:

- Appears when near NPCs or global peds
- Only accessible by players with `ambulance` job

You can expand this or bind `TriggerEvent('operating:prepareSurgery')` to your EMS tablet or other menu system.

- server.lua           â†’ XP, pay, MDT log
- config.lua           â†’ configurable items, trauma list, tiers
- fxmanifest.lua       â†’ FiveM resource declaration

ðŸ§¾ MDT LOGGING
This script logs:
- Surgery result
- Illness/trauma
- Timestamps
- Screenshot (if supported)
- Tags for search (e.g., "trauma", "gunshot")

ðŸ§  USAGE
1. Ensure all items (e.g., anesthesia_kit, surgical_kit) are added to ox_inventory
2. Place your operating table coords in `Config.OperatingTables`
3. Place the resource in your server's resources folder
4. Add `ensure advanced_surgery_system` to server.cfg
